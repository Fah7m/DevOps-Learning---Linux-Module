# DevOps-Learning---Linux-Module
Welcome to my Repo for the Linux Module.

Here I will document some notes of useful commands and the levels 1-20 of the overthewire bandit game.

**My Take on the Module:**

When I first came to this module I already had a understanding of linux as I used day to day at my work but after doing the first couple overthewire bandit games, I realised that I was out of depth with it.

I first tried to get past this module very fast and managed to watch all the videos within 2 days but SadServers and OvertheWire humbled me very fast. I thought knowing how to operate the CLI and understanding where to find files, read them and edit them was enough (80% of what I do with Linux at work). 

I won't lie, I did struggle with the overthewire bandit games and had to google and ask chatGPT for hints and guidance as some of these commands I never knew even existed. I am grateful to the CoderCo team for adding these games into the module as it unlocks a way better understanding of Linux and how to do tasks ina  very efficient way.

As I'm writing this I've managed to complete the first 11 levels and hope to power through the other 9 by the end of the day inshallah.
