Overthewire Level 20-21! 🏁
------

The way I approached this was by first creating two terminals (This can also just be done by doing screen)

I then ran the following

I then saw that I parsed the arguement -p when that was not needed (bad habit I picked up)

After running it without -p parsed, I went into my other terminal to then simply run the executable file and the port specified as a commandline arguement

And here I went back to my orginal terminal and the password displayed.
